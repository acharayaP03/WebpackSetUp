# WebpackSetUp


# This is a very simple setup for Webpack work flow for learning purpose. In order to see more advanced set up please see other repo.

# Clone this repo on your local, 
# Then from your terminal "npm install" to down all your dependencies. 

# Note: this will not work for the initial stage, since we are running on node js live server module, first build the porject, then view it on browser, follow all the commits message to get more details. since we will be installing, webpack-dev-server for development.
